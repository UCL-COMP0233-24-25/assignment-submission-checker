# Assignment Specifications

This folder contains `.json` specifications that the `assignment-submission-checker` package requires when validating submissions.

Do not delete this folder.
If this folder is relocated, `assignment_submission_checker.cli:ASSIGNMENT_SPEC_REFERENCES` needs to be correspondingly updated too.

## Naming Convention

The naming convention for files in this folder should be

`YYYY-assignment_id`

where `YYYY` is the academic year the assignment is set in;

- `2024` would correspond to the `2024-2025` academic year, starting Sept 2024,
- `2025` would correspond to the `2025-2026` academic year, starting Sept 2025,

and `assignment_id` is the ID of the assignment itself;

- `001`, `002`, etc are used for assignments 1 and 2 (respectively),
- `LSA` is used for the late summer assessment.
